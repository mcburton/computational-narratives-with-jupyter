# Composing Computational Narratives with Jupyter


Repository for a short workshop introducing Jupyter and computational narratives.


## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept and potential significance of computational narratives.

2. Describe the architecture of a Jupyter notebook environment, including the notebook server, programming language kernels, and situate Jupyter notebooks as part of the wider Jupyter ecosystem.

3. Use a Jupyter notebook to create, manage and report on the execution of a programmatic workflow using a structured document combining narrative text, executable code, executed code output and embedded media items.

4. Know about how Jupyter Notebooks are being used in teaching, reproducible research, and computational publishing.
